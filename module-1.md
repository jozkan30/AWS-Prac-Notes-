### Introduction: 
- The client server model: Almost all of modern computing uses a basic client-server model. 
- In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ( Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.
- For example, suppose that a client makes a request for a news article, the score in an online game, or a funny cat video. The server evaluates the details of this request and fulfills it by returning the information to the client.

- Cloud Computing: The on- demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay as you go pricing.
On demand delivery = the resources are already there, scale up and down when needed.

- Googles definition: The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

Types of Cloud-Computing:

There are three main models for cloud computing. Each model represents a different part of the cloud computing stack.

- Infrastructure as a Service: Contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking features, computers, and data storage space. Provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources. 

- Platform as a Service: Removes the need for organizations manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allow you to focus on the deployment and management of your application. 

- Software as a Service:  Provides the client with a completed product that is run and managed by service provider. Most people refereeing to Saas are referring to end-user applications. With a Saas offering you do not have to think about how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. 
EX: Gmail, Netflix, thing that are just a software. 

- Deployment models for cloud-computing:  When selecting a cloud strategy a company must consider factors such as required cloud application components, preferred resource management tools, and any legacy IT infrastructure requirements.

The three cloud computing deployment models are cloud-based, on-premises, and hybrid.

- 1.) Cloud-Based Deployment:
	- Run all parts of the application in the cloud
	- Migrate existing applications to the cloud
	- Design and build new applications in the cloud
- 2.) On- Premises Deployment:
	- Also know as private cloud deployment. 
	- Deploy resources by using virtualization and resource management tools
	- Increase resource utilization by using application management and virtualization technologies.
- 3.)Hybrid Deployment: 
	- Cloud based resources are connected to on-premises infrastructure.
